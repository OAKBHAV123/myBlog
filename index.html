<h2>To print to the JS console, you must use a built-in method like console.log (), throw (), etc. In addition, there is nothing wrong with the behavior of throw () as you seem to imply - the fact that it stops execution is intentional and documented ( developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/â€¦ ), and it's consistent</h2>
